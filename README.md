A Google Chrome extension that fetches the first image result that matches the current tab link from Bing Images

While learning how to make a Google Chrome extension I followed the Getting Started guide at developer.chrome.com but the the Google Web Search API is officially deprecated as of November 1, 2010. So I modified the code so the extension uses the Bing Image Search API.
